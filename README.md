# AlphaGo
This project is a student-led replication of Alpha Go code. Education and details from DeepMind's publication in Nature (2016) : https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf 

This code is implemented exclusively in Python, and the NN made with Keras, as we're trying to make it clear !
